## Getting Started

⚠️ For this project, the default package manager utilized is `pnpm`. If you would like to use a different one, you can modify the `.lintstagedrc.js` and `husky` files accordingly.

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
